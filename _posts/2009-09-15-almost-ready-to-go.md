Hi! If you are reading this, you probably already know that my name is Tim Burr. I am a junior at the University of Oklahoma, where I study computer science and math. I am writing this because I am going to study in England for the semester, and a blog seems like an easy way to keep in touch with people back home.

In a little over 24 hours, I will board a plane for Zurich, Switzerland. I am going to spend the rest of the week mit mein Kolleg Jerry Arnold, before flying on to London on Saturday. From there I will make my way to the University of Hertfordshire, which is in Hatfield- about an hour north of London.

That's it for today (got to finish packing) but I will try to update from Switzerland. See you later,

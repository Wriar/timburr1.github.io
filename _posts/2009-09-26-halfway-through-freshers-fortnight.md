The English students have started moving in. After being in England for a week, I will finally meet some Britons. (I don't count the two conversations I've had w/ the locals so far, since they both consisted of said locals complaining about what a horrible town Hatfield is.) The international students all seem pretty friendly, though. I guess being more or less on your own in a foreign country will do that to you.

The grand opening of the Forum was last night. This is UH's student union, but that means something very different here than in the states. The place is more night club than anything else, with three bars and a giant dance floor. It was full to capacity last night, ~2,000 people or so. The local students are apparently super-excited about it, which is understandable, as there doesn't seem to be much else to do unless you want to take a train into London.

Speaking of which, that is exactly what I will be doing tomorrow! I think it's going to be Banksy day... 

I got in a bit of exploring today, as well. The Uni hired a couple of buses to take international students into nearby St. Albans, which was fun. The town quaint in a Mary Poppins kind of way, full of stereotypical English houses and pubs with colorful names. You can see the remains of a Roman wall built ~250, when the place was called Verlumamium. There is also a cathedral built on the site where Britain's first Christian martyr was killed. This was very impressive; apparently it used to be one of the largest churches in the world.

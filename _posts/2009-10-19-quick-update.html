Well, I'm two weeks into my classes at UH. At this point, it looks like these will all be at least mildly interesting, without being too difficult. Neat surprise: apparently "Hardware Platforms and Interface Technology" is secret British code for "Video Game Consoles". I'm pretty sure I will be able to stick my final project into an Xbox 360 and play it. :)<br /><br />Last weekend was a good one. Friday night was the day-glo party at the Forum, and the next day the whole house (except for Emilio, who was in Oxford) took a trip to St. Albans. We didn't do any sight-seeing this time, but I got a tasty doughnut and a couple of TopMan shirts. I look like a proper English boy now, albeit a hairy one. <br /><br />T-minus (almost exactly) four days to Paris!

Today was interesting. Apparently the Commons has changed management two or three times since I moved out, and I am no longer in their records. They won't let me move in until they do a background check, which won't happen until monday, at the earliest. Until then, I'm homeless and sleeping on Katie's couch.

So... Glasgow. It is very much a working town- not nearly as picturesque as the capitol, but it was nice enough. My favorite part was the trip to the Glengoyne Whiskey Distillery. It's about 45 minutes north of the town; when I went, the countryside was gorgeous in the snow. I toured the works, which was really interesting. At the end, I tried single malt Scotch for the first time.

After I got back that night, I met up w/ Cliff for dinner. He is studying at Uni Glasgow, and it was his first day in country. We went out the Basement Bar afterword. Cliff was really funny- he kept getting up to chat with the dj or ask about good Glaswegian bands.

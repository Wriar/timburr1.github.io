### Research
[Delayed high school start times later than 8:30 AM and impact on
graduation rates and attendance rates](../../../../../papers/mckeever2017.pdf) (PDF)  
> Attendance rates and graduation rates significantly improved in schools with delayed start times of 8:30 AM or later. School officials need to take special notice that this investigation also raises questions about whether later start times are a mechanism for closing the achievement gap due to improved graduation rates.

[Employment Outcomes of Bachelor’s Degree Holders](../../../../../papers/Employment Outcomes of Bachelor’s Degree Holders.pdf) (PDF)  
> The average unemployment rate for 25- to 29-year old bachelor’s degree holders was lower in 2018 than in 2010 (2.9 vs. 5.6 percent). However, the median annual earnings of these 25- to 29-year-olds, in constant 2018 dollars, were not measurably different between these two years. 

[Sleepmore in Seattle: Later school start times are associated with more sleep and better performance in high school students](../../../../../papers/dunster2018.pdf) (PDF)  
> Most teenagers are chronically sleep deprived. One strategy proposed to lengthen adolescent sleep is to delay secondary school start times. This would allow students to wake up later without shifting their bedtime, which is biologically determined by the circadian clock, resulting in a net increase in sleep. So far, there is no objective quantitative data showing that a single intervention such as delaying the school start time significantly increases daily sleep. The Seattle School District delayed the secondary school start time by nearly an hour. We carried out a pre-/post-research study and show that there was an increase in the daily median sleep duration of 34 min, associated with a 4.5% increase in the median grades of the students and an improvement in attendance. 

[Spaced Repetition for Efficient Learning]() - Gwern  
> Spaced repetition is a centuries-old psychological technique for efficient memorization & practice of skills where instead of attempting to memorize by ‘cramming’, memorization can be done far more efficiently by instead spacing out each review, with increasing durations as one learns the item, with the scheduling done by software. Because of the greater efficiency of its slow but steady approach, spaced repetition can scale to memorizing hundreds of thousands of items (while crammed items are almost immediately forgotten) and is especially useful for foreign languages & medical studies.

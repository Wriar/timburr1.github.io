**Some thoughts**:  
1. The Egyptian is a pretty cool place to go see a concert. You can stand up front and dance if you want, or just chill in your seat. Either way, probably no one will spill beer on you.  
2. The opener was a folky kind of act called Vandaveer, from D.C. They are really very good.

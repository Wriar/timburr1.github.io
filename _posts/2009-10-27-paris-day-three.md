Katie and I were so exhausted from walking something like 18mi. on saturday that we decided to sleep in sunday morning. We checked out by 9 or so, and went out for one more day of exploring. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs091.snc3/15856_171901521086_524306086_3417755_2140739_n.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 201px; height: 302px;" src="http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs091.snc3/15856_171901521086_524306086_3417755_2140739_n.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>We headed south to the Isle St-Louis via the Place de Bastille. On the island we saw a sweet old church- I think it was called the Chappele St. Louis. A little old man stopped us to say (in Italian) that the organ dated back to the 1800s, and had recently been restored. We also stopped for a bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berthillon">Glaces Berthillon</a> before deciding to go to the Jardin des Plantes in front of the Gallerie Nacionale. It was very nice- full of green spaces and tree-shaded paths. We made our way back toward the Chatelet les Halles, stopping for one last look at Notre Dame, which is just as impressive from the back. Then it was time to head our separate ways. Saying goodbye is never fun, but we both knew that the amazing weekend couldn't last forever.

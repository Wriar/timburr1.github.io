### Commonwealth of Jatra 
Occupying only a small stretch of the Emerald Coast, the mountainous nation of Jatra extends inland along the Sanmar Range. This country is populated exclusively by a species of bipedal tortoises known for their even-tempers and financial acumen.

The senate of Jatra initially joined the Mercer League when Queen Sofia offered them investment opportunities in trading ventures. When returns from these initial ventures surpassed expectations, merchants and usurers from Jatra began joining expeditions and moving to settlements in the Sea's Edge. Because of their long lifespans, the goal of nearly every Jatran is to earn enough of a fortune for a long retirement in along the mountain lakes of their ancestral home.

Khali (खाली) is the only deity worshiped by Jatrans. Khali is said to have reached from the void and bestowed on their race the gifts of reason and speech. Khali is a lawful neutral god that teaches of a heavily deterministic universe.

Culturally, the denizens of Jatra are very averse to instability, uncertainty, and even the concept of luck. They see themselves as existing in an ordered universe where individuals are responsible for everything that happens to them (they will often lean on the teaching of Khali "Each seed to its sower").

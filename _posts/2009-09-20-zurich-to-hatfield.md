I enjoyed my stay in Switzerland. Jerry showed me around Luzern on Friday morning, but he had a school trip in the afternoon, so his sister Nela took me all over Zug and the surrounding countryside. We saw Jerry's Schule in Menzingen. This was interesting. The building is very modern, but there is a farm next door and the cornfield runs right up against the school. The view was great.

That night we went to the Blues Brothers bar in Zug to meet Nela's friend. Jerry and his girlfriend showed up late, fresh from their trip to the opera. I tried flumli. If you order this at Blues Brothers, you are given an espresso, a small glass of schnapps and a cigarette lighter. You put two sugars in the coffee, and drink it w/out stirring. When you are down to a sugary brown sludge, you add the schnapps. Using your spoon and the lighter (which is more like a mini-acetylene torch), you burn the sugar off and drink the remainder once it cools. It's good, but very strong.

The next morning, Jerry and I took the train into Zurich. After checking in for my flight, we when back downtown to eat lunch and look around. We saw the Landemusuem, the opera, the  Zentral Bibliothek, and the University of Zurich. Then it was back to the Flughafen to catch my flight to Heathrow.

There were some delays, but I finally made it to Hatfield at about 10 last night. I've spent most of today wandering around town; it seems nice enough, but I don't know how much there is to do. Fortunately, the Uni has an impressive new student center and a train ticket to London isn't terribly expensive. 

It's almost time for dinner, so I will leave you with a joke. Have you heard the one about the guy who gets a call from his wife as he's driving down the freeway? "Honey, be careful. I just heard on the radio that some lunatic is driving the wrong way down the freeway." 

"One lunatic? There's hundreds of 'em!"

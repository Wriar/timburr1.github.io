I heard way too many dramatic stories tonight about things that happened on Facebook. Between that and being creeped right the hell out by <a href="http://www.iamrogue.com/catfish.html">Catfish</a>, I am starting to wonder if I really need to be putting myself online so that people can look at pictures of me in a Rocky Horror costume, or rag on me for posting too many stories from the New York Times. (Get it Matt, rag?)<br /><br />England friends, Michigan friends, OK friends who are out of town: I want to stay in touch with you. But how about I give you an email address or phone number? I haven't made up my mind yet, but I'm thinking about deactivating the ol' FB account, and instead using this blog to post news articles and interesting musings.<br /><br />What say you?

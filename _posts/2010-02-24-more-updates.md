I have decided to start posting on here again, although probably not quite as frequently as before. This blog has been a good way to stay in touch and practice writing every now and then. However, life in Oklahoma is a bit less adventure-filled than life in England. Much more of my time is consumed by school, work, and my beautiful girlfriend, although I will still write about any interesting things I do in the meantime. Additionally, I plan to write about: books, software, Magic: the Gathering, the Prime Minister of Italy*, and why I hate Glenn Beck.  
   
*Warning: If Silvio Berlusconi is not one of your top five favorite heads of state, you might not enjoy this blog. If you do not have a top five, you should work on that, starting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Berlusconi#Legal_problems">here</a>.

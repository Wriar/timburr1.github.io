[Foundations of Information Security: A Straightforward Introduction](https://nostarch.com/foundationsinfosec) - Jason Andress

## [1. Introduction](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 1 - Introduction.pptx)
McCumber Cybersecurity Model: Protect information in transmission, in storage, while processing. Includes technology, policies & practices, and education.

**Information Security Triad:**
Confidentiality  
Integrity  
Availability  

**Risk Management Process:**
1. Identify Assets
2. Identify Threats
3. Assess Vulnerabilities
4. Assess Risks
5. Mitigate Risks

## [2. Identification and Authentication](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 2 - Identification and Authentication.pptx)
Need to verify identities, so that we can ensure that only authorized users can see or modify data.

**ID factors:**  
* What you know:  password, PIN, answer to secret question
* What you have: ATM card, cell phone, smart token
* What you are: biometrics (more on this later)
* What you do: keystroke patterns, voice patterns, signature recognition
* Where you are: at a specific location, using a specific device (trusted path)

## [3. Authorization and Access Control](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 3 - Authorization and Access Control.pptx)
Controlled access: which subjects (human users) have access (read/write/execute) to which objects (files, directories)?

Windows access control lists vs. Linux chmod

Rule-based vs. role-based access control

**Multilevel security models:**
* Bell-LaPadula (BLP) Model (most influential)
* Biba Integrity Model
* Brewer and Nash model (Chinese Wall Model)

## [4. Auditing Accountability](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 4 - Auditing Accountability.pptx)

**TODO**

## [5. Cryptography](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 5 - Cryptography.pptx)

**TODO**

## [6. Compliance](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 6 - Compliance.pptx)

**TODO**

## [7. Operations Security](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 7 - Operations Security.pptx)
1. Identify critical information. can be internally defined (source code, trade secret, etc.) or external (HIPAA, FERPA, GDPR, etc.)  
2. Threat analysis  
3. Vulnerability analysis  
4. Risk assessment  
5. Apply countermeasures  

**Laws of OpSec**  
1. Know the threats  
2. Know what to protect  
3. Protect the information  

## [8. Human Security](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 8 - Human Security.pptx)
Password attacks: brute-force vs. dictionary attacks

Social engineering: phishing, spam, pretexting, tailgating, shoulder-surfing

## [9. Physical Security](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 9 - Physical Security.pptx)
Protect the data by protecting people, equipment, and facilities.

**Major sources of physical threats:**  
* Extreme temperature - extreme heat or cold
* Gases – includes humidity or dry air, gases, suspended particles
* Liquids – includes water, chemicals
* Living organisms – viruses, bacteria, animals, insects
* Projectiles -- powered objects
* Movement – shaking, collapse, slide, vibrating
* Energy anomalies - electrical surge, static electricity, radiation
* People
* Toxins
* Smoke and fire

**Physical security controls:**  
* Deterrent controls - discourage people from violating the security controls.
* Detective controls - sense and report undesirable events.
* Preventive controls - physical means to keep unauthorized entities from breaching your physical security.

## [10. Network Security](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 10 - Network Security.pptx)
**ISO/OSI Reference Model**  
Provides a common basis for coordination of standards.  
Based on a hierarchical model:  
* Application Layer
* Presentation Layer
* Session Layer
* Transport Layer
* Network Layer
* Data Link Layer
* Physical Layer

**TODO**

## [11. Operating System Security](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 11 - Operating System Security.pptx)
Operating System: mediates between user/applications and computer hardware; manages resources and permissions.

OS Hardening: 
* Remove unnecessary software
* Remove unneeded services
* Alter or remove default accounts
* Use principles of least privilege
* Update software
* Implement logging and auditing

## [12. Mobile, Embedded, and Internet of Things Security](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 12 - Mobile, Embedded System, IoT Security.pptx)

**TODO**

## [13a. Web Security](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 13 - Web Security.pptx)
Web Bugs / Tracking Pixels  

Clickjacking

Drive-By Downloading

**Obtaining user or web site data:**
* Dot-Dot-Slash
* Cross-Site Scripting
* SQL Injection

Prevention: sanatize your inputs!

## [13b. Software Security](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 13 - Web Security.pptx)
**Secure programming / design principles:**
1. Least privilege  
2. Fail-safe defaults  
3. Economy of mechanism    
4. Complete remediation  
5. Separation of privilege  
6. Open design  
7. Least common mechanism  
8. Least astonishment

[IEEE Center for Secure Design, “Avoiding the Top 10 Software Security Design Flaws”](../../../papers/CYB110/CybersecurityInitiative-online.pdf)
1. Use an authentication mechanism that cannot be bypassed or tampered with
2. Authorize after you authenticate
3. External components change the attack surface
4. Earn or give, but never assume trust
5. Define an approach that ensures all inputs/data are explicitly validated
6. Strictly separate data and control instructions, and never process control instructions from untrusted sources
7. Identify sensitive data and how they should be handled
8. Use cryptography correctly
9. Always consider users
10. Be flexible when considering future changes to objects and actors

Secure coding 
* A style of programming that prevents abnormal termination or unexpected actions.
* Handles bad input gracefully
* Detects internal errors and handles them gracefully.

Defensive programming  
* What could someone deliberately do to compromise your program?
* What could someone unintentionally do to compromise your program?

What a great weekend! Friday was (my housemate) Rachel's birthday, and we went out to dinner at the Italian restaurant in the Galleria to celebrate. Unfortunately, I had to skip the silent disco afterword, since I didn't have any money. This bears explaining. A silent disco is just like a regular one, except instead of playing music on one set of speakers, everyone rents out wireless headphones. Does anyone know if they have these in the US?

I got some work done on Saturday, and spent the evening watching Bedlam on <a href="http://www.p2p4u.net/">p2p4u.net</a>. All I have to say about that is: 27-0.

Sunday, there was a trip for international students to Stratford-Upon-Avon. It was pretty incredible, walking around the same streets and standing in the same rooms where William Shakespeare grew up. You can't see the house he bought after making a fortune with the Lord Chamberlain's Men, since it was demolished in 1759. However, we did get to see John Shakespeare's house (where Will was probably born), his grammar school, and the church where he was baptized and buried. His epigraph:

"Good frend for Iesvs sake forbeare,

To digg the dvst encloased heare.

Blese be ye man yt spares thes stones,

And cvrst be he yt moves my bones."

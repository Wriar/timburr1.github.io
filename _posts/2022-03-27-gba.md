The [Gameboy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance) is my favorite handheld console of all time, and not just for nostalgia reasons (the GBA turns 21 this summer.) It is basically a little Super Nintendo with built-in screen and controller, so you can carry it around in your pocket. It's easy to repair and modify, and had a bunch of great games.

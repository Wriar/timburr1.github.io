I went to see the Decemberists today at the Botanical Garden. It was a great show. The opening act was a local band called Typhoon, and they were really good. Kind of like BSS, but with discernible lyrics. They had 13 people on stage, singing and playing horns and guitars and violins. I think the word is "soundscape." Then the Decemberists came on:  
  
"This is Sam Adams, mayor of Portland, Oregon. This message is not prerecorded; I am speaking to you live. I am floating above you in a blue geodesic dome. Do not be alarmed."  
  
**The set list:**  
July, July  
You Are My Sunshine (Seriously, Colin Meloy was called offstage here by one of the audio techs, and none of the other band members could come up with a joke to tell.)  
Down by the Water  
Calamity Song  
Rise to Me  
Shiny  
*Pause here to borrow sun hats from various audience members.*  
The Rake's Song  
We Both Go Down Together  
Won't Want for Love  
The Crane Wife (all three parts!)  
All Arise!  
Rox in the Box  
("We're glad to be in Boise; you've all been so accommodating... that this next song is about imagined Latino gangland warfare in California:)   
Oh, Valencia   
This Is Why We Fight  
**The encore:**  
Raincoat Song  
The Chimbley Sweep (Pause in the middle for Colin Meloy to trade places w/ the drummer, who proceeds to play a cowbell and then sing something you could probably call the Failed Cowbell Solo Blues.)  
June Hymn

I went to see Cake on Friday night at the Idaho Botanical Garden, along with Katie and Jason Keffer. It was a really good show. John McCrea does most of the heavy lifting, but the rest of the band seems to have really improved since they started putting out albums in the mid-90s. **The set list:**  
Sad Songs and Waltzes  
Opera Singer  
Frank Sinatra  
Arco Arena  
Wheels  
Stick Shifts and Safety Belts  
Sheep Go to Heaven  
Comanche  
Rock 'n Roll Lifestyle  
Long Time  
Mustache Man  
Federal Funding  
Sick of You   
*Intermission*  
Love You Madly  
Haze of Love  
Guitar  
Satan Is My Motor ("I know there are probably a lot of religious fundamentalists in the audience. But this is just a metaphor, so you can still go to heaven if you sing along. Probably.")  
*Brief pause here to give away a willow tree, apparently they do this at all of their shows.*  
Jolene  
Pentagram  
Never There (The trumpet player has gotten so much better since this song first came out. He used to sound like the first or second chair in a fair-to-middling high school band.)  
**Encore:**  
Short Skirt, Long Jacket  
The Distance

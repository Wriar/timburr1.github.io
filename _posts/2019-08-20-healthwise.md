I was born in Houston, TX and grew up in a small town in southeast Michigan. I moved to Boise in 2012, after completing a master's degree at the University of Oklahoma. I love to read, travel, get outdoors, and play all sorts of games with my friends and my beautiful wife Katie. An interesting thing about me: I donated bone marrow several years ago, so now there is a little girl in Nevada whose immune system is 87% my immune system. Weird. I am excited to join Healthwise as a Senior Software Engineer on the Solutions Team!

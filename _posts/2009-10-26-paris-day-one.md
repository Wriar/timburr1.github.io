The trip took me about an hour longer than I was expecting, so I arrived at the hotel at about 1600 to find Katie waiting there. After a quick dinner (bread, cheese, and ham from a local grocery) we made it to the Louvre.  

Let me tell you about the Louvre. You go into the main foyer, under the glass pyramid and they have free maps, printed in about eight different languages. You figure out what you want to see first, orient yourself and go one of three escalators, depending on what you picked. Show them a passport to prove that you are under 26, and you're in, free of charge. You think you know how to get to the painting/sculpture/whatever that you are aiming for- we picked the Venus de Milo. Ten minutes later you are completely lost, but you don't care because "Hey, look over there!" The place is enormous, and everything in it is worth seeing. The museum closed long before we were ready to leave- we never did make it to the armless Aphrodite. However, we did see: the Mona Lisa, Winged Victory of Samothrace, the Raft of the Medusa, 20ft. tall Assyrian centaurs, room after room of Greco-Roman marble statues... It was absolutely incredible.  

After leaving the museum, we were both pretty exhausted from our respective journeys. We decided to hike back to the hotel and call it a night, then get an early start the next morning.

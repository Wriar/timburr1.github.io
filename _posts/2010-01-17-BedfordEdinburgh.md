I made it to Katie's yesterday. The money is all the same size again, and everyone drives on the right side of the road. When I was waiting in line to get my passport checked, the man in front of me turned around and spontaneously started a conversation; it is good to be home. 

But back to the story. I flew from Dublin to Edinburgh, my single favorite city on the trip. Edinburgh Castle is really cool; it costs like 10E to get in, but there is so much to see! From the Scottish crown jewels to the National War Memorial to the spectacular view out over the city.

On my second day in town, I caught the bus to Rosslyn Chapel (that's the one from The Da Vinci Code). You know how Tom Hanks walks into the crypt down that stairway w/ the Star of David? You can still see where the movie crew cleaned the wall to stick it on there. That's just about the only carving the chapel doesn't have, though. The place is full of weird, asymmetrical carvings of plants and people. The walls tell stories from the Bible and the Apocrypha, stories about the St. Clair family and Robert the Bruce, and there is a weird little murder story behind the three pillars in front of the alter. The strangest thing might be the Green Men, though. The chapel has about 100 carvings of faces w/ vines coming out of their mouths, and old Pagan symbol for nature and fertility.

I bought a copy of the Scotsman when I saw that the bus ride to Roslin was almost an hour each way. Page 3 was about halfway taken up by a story about a new type of tartan being introduced. You know you are in Scotland when...

Confession: I tried haggis, but it was in a vegetarian restaurant, so it was mostly peanuts. It was delicious, though. I also like Irn-Bru, which is basically extra-fizzy orange pop. It is pretty much the national drink of Scotland, the only country where the leading soft drink is not Coke or Pepsi.

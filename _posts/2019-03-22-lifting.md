I am weightlifting again, according to the 5/3/1 program as detailed [here](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/5-3-1-for-beginners/) or [here](https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101065094-5-3-1-for-a-beginner). Current training maxes (I deloaded the lower body lifts substantially after tweaking my back last month):

|              | TM |
|--------------|----|
|bench press   | 230|
|squat         | 235|
|deadlift      | 225|
|overhead press| 135|

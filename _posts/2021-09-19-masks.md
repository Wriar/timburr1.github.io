Updated on 10/7/2021: Cases still trending upward, but the medical system is too overwhelmed to provide exact numbers:

<img src="/images/warning.png" alt="Due to the recent surge in infections, case investigation data are missing for approximately 8,260 outstanding positive laboratory results that are pending local public health district review and follow-up.">

Meanwhile, [3,000 Idahoans are dead,](https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/coronavirus/article254815942.html) hospitals are working under [crisis standards of care,](https://healthandwelfare.idaho.gov/crisis-standards-care) and [Ada county has rented a refrigerated trailer to store dead bodies](https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/ada-county-coroners-office-gets-new-trailer-to-store-bodies/277-2f9af4e9-5ba2-4e76-8503-066f7c0bbe8b) because the morgue is full.

That's the bad news, but the good news is that you can help! At this point in the pandemic, we are pretty sure that covid-19 is [mostly transmitted throught air, via aerosols and respiratory droplets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_of_COVID-19). Mechanically, it makes sense that masks would help to prevent the spread, see: [Visualizing Speech-Generated Oral Fluid Droplets with Laser Light Scattering](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2007800) from the New England Journal of Medicine.  
If you disagree with that proposition, why? Do you also not cover your mouth when you sneeze? Gross. So masks might plausibly help, but *do* they, in reality? Not perfectly, but there is a lot of evidence that masking up does help at the population level:

> If the shortage ends, and wearing a mask is cost-free, I agree with the guidelines from China, Hong Kong, and Japan – consider wearing a mask in high-risk situations like subways or crowded buildings. Wearing masks will not make you invincible, and if you risk compensate even a little it might do more harm than good. Realistically you should be avoiding high-risk situations like subways and crowded buildings as much as you possibly can. But if you have to go in them, yes, most likely a mask will help.  
> In low-risk situations, like being at home or taking a walk, I mean sure, a mask might make you 0.0001% (or whatever) less likely to get infected. If that’s worth it to you, consider the possibility that you might be freaking out a little too much about this whole pandemic thing. If it’s still worth it, go for it.

> A randomized-trial of community-level mask promotion in rural Bangladesh during COVID-19 shows that the intervention tripled mask usage and reduced symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, demonstrating that promoting community mask-wearing can improve public health.

I've decided that I really like exploring foreign cities; I just hate getting to and from them. I flew into Madrid thursday night, planning on catching the metro to Estación Nuevos Ministerios and taking a train from there to Alcalá de Henares, where Katie is living. This didn't work, due to an unlikely set of circumstances, and I ended up spending the night in the bus stop above the metro station. I caught the first train to Alcalá friday morning, where I waited for three hours because Katie's alarm never went off. Not fun.  

Fortunately, the day went uphill quickly. After a quick nap, Katie showed me around Alcalá. We saw el Museo de Arqueología y el Museo de Cervantes, as well as several statues of Don Quixote. Apparently, most Spaniards love Cervantes, but especially the Alcallenos, since he was born there.  

We also saw la Universidad, some sweet old architecture, and this weird little art shop/museum. Then we went back to her apartment and played Hotels with her flatmates. It's a board game similar to Monopoly- kind of simplistic, but great if you want to practice su numeros.  

Spanish food of the day: Tortillas, but not the kind you are thinking of. These are really thick potato and onion omelets, cooked in olive oil.

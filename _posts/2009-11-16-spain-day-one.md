I've decided that I really like exploring foreign cities; I just hate getting to and from them. I flew into Madrid thursday night, planning on catching the metro to Estación Nuevos Ministerios and taking a train from there to Alcalá de Henares, where Katie is living. This didn't work, due to an unlikely set of circumstances, and I ended up spending the night in the bus stop above the metro station. I caught the first train to Alcalá friday morning, where I waited for three hours because Katie's alarm never went off. Not fun.<br /> <br />Fortunately, the day went uphill quickly. After a quick nap, Katie showed me around Alcalá. We saw el Museo de Arqueología y el Museo de Cervantes, as well as several statues of Don Quixote. Apparently, most Spaniards love Cervantes, but especially the Alcallenos, since he was born there. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs024.snc3/11139_194510861457_710286457_4067022_7661925_n.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 302px; height: 201px;" src="http://photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs024.snc3/11139_194510861457_710286457_4067022_7661925_n.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>We also saw la Universidad, some sweet old architecture, and this weird little art shop/museum. Then we went back to her apartment and played Hotels with her flatmates. It's a board game similar to Monopoly- kind of simplistic, but great if you want to practice su numeros.<br /><br />Spanish food of the day: Tortillas, but not the kind you are thinking of. These are really thick potato and onion omelets, cooked in olive oil.

[M:tG Arena](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena) has the slickest interface, and the best drafting experience for new sets.

[Magic Online](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo) (aka MODO) has the Cube.  

[Cockatrice]((https://cockatrice.github.io/)) is decent, free, and supports multiplayer:  
* Install cockatrice and run the Oracle tool.
* Build or import a deck.
* Menu: Cockatrice -> Register to server... 
* Create an account, and consider supporting [Rooster Ranges](https://cockatrice.us/index.php).
* Menu: Cockatrice -> Connect
* Create or join a game.

[Joe Rogan Experience #1361 - Cmdr. David Fravor & Jeremy Corbell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eco2s3-0zsQ) - YouTube  

[What The Hell Is Going On With UFOs And The Department Of Defense?](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/27666/what-the-hell-is-going-on-with-ufos-and-department-of-defense)  

[‘Wow, What Is That?’ Navy Pilots Report Unexplained Flying Objects](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/26/us/politics/ufo-sightings-navy-pilots.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share) - NYT  

So what's the deal?  

You can download the FOIA'ed videos [here](https://www.navair.navy.mil/foia/documents). I am totally unqualified to evaluate these. The ones I've seen are weird, but none of them was obviously a spacecraft. (Although see above; Rogan and Corbell really WANT TO BELIEVE but Cmdr. Fravor seems sober, competent, and convinced that he saw something weird during the [Nimitz incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Nimitz_UFO_incident). Same for the pilots in the Times article, except wrt the [Theodore Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Theodore_Roosevelt_UFO_incidents).)

Mick West gives some plausible-sounding explanations at [MetaBunk](https://www.metabunk.org/threads/explained-new-navy-ufo-videos.11234/), which I'm inclined to accept. Probably we are dealing with sensor artifacts and parallax, not ET. Oh well...

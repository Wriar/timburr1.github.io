[GENOtation](https://genotation.stanford.edu/#start)  
> The purpose of GENOtation is to provide an application for users to look up their genotype and interpret how their specific genotype affects their risk for disease, ancestry, and traits. There is an immense amount of information about how DNA variation affects individual disease risk and traits. There are millions of people that have access to their genotype files from companies, such as 23andme. GENOtation will let users look up their own genotype for the SNPs identified in these GWAS studies. We hope to provide users with a means to unlock the vast amount of information in the published scientific literature.

[Promethease](https://www.promethease.com/)  
> Promethease is a literature retrieval system that builds a personal DNA report based on connecting a file of DNA genotypes to the scientific findings cited in SNPedia.
> Biomedical researchers, healthcare practitioners and customers of DNA testing services (such as 23andMe, Ancestry.com, FamilyTreeDNA, Genos, etc.) use Promethease to retrieve information published about their DNA variations. Most reports cost $12 and are produced in under 10 minutes. Much larger data files (such as imputed full genomes) have increased runtime. Uploading additional data files into the same report costs an additional $4. 

[SNPedia](https://www.snpedia.com/)  
> SNPedia is a wiki investigating human genetics. We share information about the effects of variations in DNA, citing peer-reviewed scientific publications. It is used by Promethease to create a personal report linking your DNA variations to the information published about them.

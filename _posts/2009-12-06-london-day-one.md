Saturday was another early morning: Katie and I caught an early train w/ Emilio and Hannah. Four-person discount for the win! For 6.25Â£ apiece, we got a train ticket into the city, and unlimited use of the tubes all day long.

We stayed in King's Cross just long enough to find platform 9 3/4 before catching the tube to Green Park. From there we went to: Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Westminster Palace, and the London Eye. After dropping our things off at the hostel, we went up to check out Hyde Park and Covent Gardens, which were both nice. Then we went to an evensong service at Westminster Abbey, where a woman politely told me that I was not allowed to take a picture of Sir Isaac Newton's tomb. We walked up to Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery, which had (among many, many other things) Titian's *Bacchus and Ariadne*. We saw the other two paintings in that cycle (*the Andrians* and *the Worship of Venus*) in el Prado. We ate dinner at Waxy O'Conner's, still the most Irish pub I have ever seen. Insider tip: the hamburgers are a much better deal than the sausage and mash. After looking at some Christmas lights and a pack of about a hundred more or less drunken Santas, we decided to call it a day. On the way back to the hostel, we decided to stop and look at the Fire Monument, and snap a quick photo of Tower Bridge and the HMS Belfast from the middle of London Bridge.

One more insider tip: if you ever find yourself in London, a day travelcard for the tubes is well worth the money, especially if you buy it after the peak hours end. After St. Paul's, we wanted to take a tour of Shakespeare's Globe Theater*, but it wasn't open when we got there. To kill some time, we walked to the Tower of London via Southwark Cathedral.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs097.snc3/16458_202154296086_524306086_3670536_1361016_n.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 302px; height: 201px;" src="http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs097.snc3/16458_202154296086_524306086_3670536_1361016_n.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs097.snc3/16458_202154341086_524306086_3670543_4551456_n.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 302px; height: 201px;" src="http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs097.snc3/16458_202154341086_524306086_3670543_4551456_n.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>The Globe tour was really interesting, although I suspect that our guide had a few of her facts mixed up. After that, we took the tube to Baker Street, just next to where Katie's airport shuttle picked her up. We saw the Sherlock Holmes Museum, but we didn't really have time to look around.<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs097.snc3/16458_202154431086_524306086_3670557_4830011_n.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 201px; height: 302px;" src="http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs097.snc3/16458_202154431086_524306086_3670557_4830011_n.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>Katie got on her bus, and I went to the museums of Natural History and Science. They were both incredible. The Natural History Museum reminded me of the Field Museum in Chicago, except in a castle. The Science museum had a big exhibit about outer space, and another one about the development of technology over the last century. <br /><br />All in all, it was a great weekend. I will miss Katie, but only until I get back to Norman in January. <br /><br /><br />*Technically, it is a really good replica located about 100 yards from the site of the original, which burned down after a special-effects mishap.

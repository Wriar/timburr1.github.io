OU/Nebraska is on halftime. (I'm watching  on <a href="http://rojadirecta.com/">Roja Directa</a>.) Both teams are playing great defense, but OU let in a flukey touchdown off of an interception. Jones seems to be attempting throws that he just doesn't have, and the special teams don't look great.

In lighter news, today I went to St. Albans w/ the roommates to watch fireworks for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_fawkes">Guy Fawkes</a> Day. Technically this was the 5th, so people have been putting on more or less sporadic pyrotechnics displays every night since Wednesday. :)

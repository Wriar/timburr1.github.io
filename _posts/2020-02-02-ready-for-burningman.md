title: Getting Ready for Burning Man 2021

**[Ticket sales for BM2020 have been postponed indefinitely](https://journal.burningman.org/2020/03/news/official-announcements/main-sale-postponed/). It looks like the event will likely be cancelled this year, and frankly from here in April it seems like holding an 80,000-person gathering in September is going to be a terrible idea, even if it's technically allowed. Hopefully we can get together again and do Misfit stuff in 2021.**

Yesterday was a good day. I went into London early to look around before the Pogues concert at 7. (I bought my ticket the day after they went on sale.) The plan was to ride in early, visit the Science Museum, and play some Magic before catching the tube to Brixton for the show.

That's pretty much what happened. I was excited to see the Difference Engine that the museum built for Babbage's 200th birthday. Since I wasn't in a hurry, I decided to stop at the Albert &amp; Victoria Museum on the way to the tournament venue. They have a really cool Donatello sculpture of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith">Judith killing Holofernes</a>; I have now seen at least one piece of artwork by everyone with a ninja turtle named after them.

I got to the County Hotel just fine, and signed up for a side draft which never happened. It was fun just hanging out with Liz and Simon, though. I wish I had known that the Legacy Grand Prix Trial was only going to draw 30 people, and most of them would play bad decks. I would definitely have tried my hand. When it became obvious that I would not have time to draft and still make the concert, I decided to walk down the block to the British Museum, which was awesome.

From there I caught the tube to the O2 Academy in Brixton. The concert was phenomenal. The <a href="http://www.marseillefigs.org/">Marseilles Figs</a> were good. The <a href="http://www.kingblues.com/">King Blues</a> (who I had never heard of and did not realize were playing) were outstanding. The Pogues blew my mind. It was like the whole crowd was starving for Shane MacGowan. I stood right in front of the stage, and when they played Body of an American, I thought I was going to get crushed by the sheer weight of thousands of people pressing forward. It was phenomenal. They pretty much followed the set list I found the other day, with the last six songs forming the two encores. It was an incredible show, and I have never seen or heard anything like it before.

Pogue Mahone.

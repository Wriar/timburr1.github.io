['Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations'](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=accelerate&qid=1567118731&s=gateway&sr=8-1)  

**Continuous Delivery Capabilities** 
1. Use version control for all production artifacts (including application code, configurations, build/environment setup scripts, etc.)
2. Automate the deployment process
3. Implement [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)  
4. Use trunk-based development methods: fewer than about three active branches, short lifetimes (ideally less than a day)
5. Implement test automation: tests should be fast, reliable, and automatic
6. Support test data maintenance: as much as it takes to automate testing, but no more
7. Shift left on security
8. Implement continuous delivery  

**Architecture Capabilities**  
9. Use a loosely coupled architecture (!)  
10. Architect for empowered teams: let them choose their own tools as much as possible  

**Product and Process Capabilities**  
11. Gather and implement customer feedback  
12. Make the flow of work visible through the value stream: "Teams should have a good understanding of and visibility into the flow of work from the business all the way through the customers..."  
13. Work in small batches  
14. Foster and enable team experimentation  

**Lean Management and Monitoring Capabilities**  
15. Have a lightweight change approval process: peer review GOOD, external change approval boards BAD  
16. Monitor accross application and infrastructure to inform business decisions  
17. Check system health proactively  
18. Improve processes and mange work with work-in-progress limits  
19. Visualize work to monitor quality and communicate throughout the team  

**Cultural Capabilities**  
20. Support a generative (i.e. Westrum) culture  
21. Encourage and support learning  
22. Support and facilitate collaboration among teams
23. Provide resources and tools that make work meaningful
24. Support or embody transformational leadership

This is a list of books and things that have had a strong influence on the way I think about the world. It's very much a work in progress.

[The Enchiridion](../../../papers/enchiridion.pdf) of Epictetus  

[GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach) by Douglas Hofstadter  

[Infinite Jest](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/ijend) by David Foster Wallace (For a shorter introduction to DFW, check out [Good Old Neon](../../../papers/GoodOldNeon.pdf), or his kinda-famous graduaction speech at Kenyon College: [This is Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI).)

[The Righteous Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Righteous_Mind) by Jonathan Haidt  

[Seeing Like A State](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/) by James C. Scott  

[SlateStarCodex](https://slatestarcodex.com/), especially [Nobody is Perfect, Everything is Commensurable](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/19/nobody-is-perfect-everything-is-commensurable/); [The Categories Were Meant for Man, Not Man for the Categories](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/); and [I Can Tolerate Anything Except the Outgroup](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/)  

[Small Gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Gods) by Terry Pratchett  

[Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) by Daniel Kahneman  

Not a book, but [James Mickens](https://mickens.seas.harvard.edu/wisdom-james-mickens) is basically right about everything: modernity is terrible and computers were a mistake.

title: About This Site
---

Hello, my name is Tim! I'm a full-stack software developer in the US Mountain West. I'm on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/timburr1), [GitHub](https://github.com/timburr1), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-burr-a39a8866). You can also email me at the reverse of moc.liamg@rrub.r.mit.

This site is meant to be a sort of scratchpad, where I can write down stuff that I want to remember or share later. It was mostly written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and compiled with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The source code is available [here](https://github.com/timburr1/timburr1.github.io). It's obviously hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

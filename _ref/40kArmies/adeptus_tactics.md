## Kill Team Tactics: Adeptus Astartes  

**Armour of Contempt:** 1 command point  
In response to a mortal wound, get a 5+ save against mortal wounds for the rest of the round, including the one you just took. Snipers, booby traps, Psykers, Chaos stratagems, GSCult Rock drills. Even tripping and falling gets around power armour. That's when you use this strat.  

**Death to Traitors!:** 1 command point  
If in melee with Chaos Marines of any flavor, hit rolls of 6+ explode into additional attacks. SUPER narrow in it's usage, but can be relevant if you find yourself fighting a Chaos Marine army.  

**Hellfire Shells:** 2 command points  
A Heavy Bolter can fire one shot, but if it hits, do D3 Mortal Wounds instead of usual wound rolls. Look at you, who's dealing the mortal wounds now? But for the cost, better make that shot count - the same assists for Masterful Marksmanship apply here.  

**Honour the Chapter:** 2 command points  
Use this Tactic at the end of the Fight phase. Pick a model from your kill team. That model can immediately fight an additional time.  

**Masterful Marksmanship:** 1 command point  
Use this Tactic in the Shooting phase when you choose an Intercessor from your kill team to shoot with a stalker bolt rifle. Until the end of that phase, you can add 1 to hit and wound rolls for that model.

**Shock and Awe:** 2 command points 
Normally, Shock grenades are used in the Shooting phase, after you decided to move instead of charge. This strat allows a Reiver to chuck a shock grenade before the charge actually happens, protecting him. As it connects, the affected model can't Overwatch that very phase, on top of -1 to hit & inability to use Overwatch or be Readied until the end of the next battle round.

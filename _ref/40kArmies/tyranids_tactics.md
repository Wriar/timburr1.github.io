## Kill Team Tactics: Tyranids 

**Adrenaline Surge:** 2 command points  
Use this tactic at the end of the fight phase. Pick a model from your kill team. That model can immediately fight an additional time.  

**Implant Attack:** 2 command points  
Use this tactic before an injury roll is made for an enemy model that was reduced to 0 wounds by a model from your kill team in the fight phase. Apply a 2+ modifier to the injury roll.  

**Legacy of Ymgarl:** 1 command point  
Use this tactic when you choose a Genestealer in your kill team to fight in the fight phase. Reroll failed wound rolls for that model until the end of the phase.

**Predatory Leap:** 1 command point  
Use this tactic before making a charge roll for a model from your kill team. Treat this model as if it could FLY when making its charge move.  

**Rapid Regeneration:** 2 command points  
Use this tactic when a model from your kill team is taken out of action. Roll a D6. On a 4+ that model is treated as if it had suffered a flesh wound instead.  

**Single-minded Annihilation:** 1-2 command points  
Use this tactic after a model from your kill team shoots in the shooting phase. You can immediately shoot an additional time with that model. This tactic costs 1 command point to use, or 2 command points if used on a Tyranid Warrior.

['The Mythical Man-Month'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)  
by Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.

This book is a classic, and includes a lot of interesting thoughts about software engineering. That said, it really shows its age: it was written in a time when all the devs were men and all the secretaries were women. Also, Brooks writes about god several times in a way that is more... earnest than you'd usually see in a book about software development.

**The Tar Pit**  
Programming is great because you get to make things that other people find useful, out of pure idea-stuff. It's kind of like solving a puzzle, and kind of like building things out of Legos, and you get to keep learning all the time.  
On the other hand, programming is terrible because the machine will do what you tell it to do, not what you want. To make a living, you mostly have to work on other people's projects, not necessarily what you would prefer to work on. Also, debugging tends to suck. So does rushing a product out to market, only to discover that it isn't actually what users want.  
*"This then is programming, both a tar pit in which many efforts have floundered and a creative activity with joys and woes all its own. The remainder of this book will attempt to lay some boardwalks across the tar."*

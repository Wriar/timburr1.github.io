[The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://www.amazon.com/Bogleheads-Guide-Investing-Taylor-Larimore/dp/0470067365)  

Malkiel: [A Random Walk down Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Random_Walk_Down_Wall_Street) is the best book-length treatment of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis that I have seen. I don't buy the strongest version of this (that it's impossible for retail investors to beat the market, net of fees), but I'm convinced that most people won't beat the market consistently, and would be better off investing in index funds.

Graham: [The Intelligent Investor](https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials/dp/0060555661) is the classic book on security valuation, but kind of dated.

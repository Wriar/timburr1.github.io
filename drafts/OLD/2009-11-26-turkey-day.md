Happy Thanksgiving everyone! I just got back from eating dinner with a bunch of other American students in Melanie's kitchen. Quote of the day came from Stein, who was talking to a piece of cheesecake: "Hello again, old friend."  
  
I am thankful for these friends, and all of the rest who are scattered across the U.S. and the rest of the world. I am thankful for my family, my health, and the fact that Silvio Berlusconi was unanimously named Rolling Stone's '<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/6638385/Silvio-Berlusconi-is-Rolling-Stone-rock-star-of-the-year.html">Rock Star of the Year</a>.'  
  
I've got to go, since my first Magic Online PTQ is about to start...

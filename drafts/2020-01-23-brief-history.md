About 13.8 billion years ago, the Big Bang happened.[^1] There was nothing, and then there was everything. Or something.  

The Earth finished coalescing about 4.5 billion years ago,[^2] and then after a mind-boggling amount of time, after the volcanoes had died down and the first oceans formed, the first single-celled, prokaryotic organisms appeared. A mind-boggling amount of time after that, one of these doohickies swallowed and sort of enslaved another one. You know the pain of these mitochondrial captives, their cries of anguish; eukaryote with you ever day.  

These new, improved doohickies figured out how to hook up like Voltron, forming a whole new kind of multicellular creature. These became bigger and more complicated, their cells gradually specializing into things like organ systems, and gradually moved out of the oceans. There were big crazy ferns for a long time, and then there was a wild parade of dinosaurs for like 100 million years. Unfortunately for the dinosaurs, a mind-bogglingly large and fast-moving asteroid hit the Earth about 65 million years ago, killing off everything bigger than bugs, tiny lizards, and the rodent-like mammals that would eventually evolve into the first primates.  

The first anatomically modern humans appeared between 250,000 and 300,000 years ago, splitting off from our nearest ape relatives: chimps and bonobos. We don't know exactly what our earliest ancestors got up to, but it probably included lots of foraging and persistence hunting. They drove most of the large mammal species alive at the time extinct, including our fellow hominids *homo sapiens neanderthalis*, interbreeding with them in the process.  

The use of stone tools and fire actually predate *homo sapiens sapiens*, but other important inventions are far more recent: our human ancestors began domesticating animals about 13,000 years ago, the practice of sowing crops began a couple thousand years after that, and then the first agricultural societies appeared in the Fertile Crescent (in modern-day Iraq) about 8,000 BC (i.e. 15,000 years ago). NB though that large-scale farming and division of labor would also be independently developed in modern-day China, India, and South America, at least.

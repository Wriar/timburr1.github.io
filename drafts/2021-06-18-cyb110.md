[Foundations of Information Security: A Straightforward Introduction](https://nostarch.com/foundationsinfosec) - Jason Andress

## [1. Introduction](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 1 - Introduction.pptx)
**McCumber Cybersecurity Model**
Protect information in transmission, in storage, while processing. Includes technology, policies & practices, and education.

**Information Security Triad:**
Confidentiality  
Integrity  
Availability  

## [2. Identification and Authentication](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 2 - Identification and Authentication.pptx)
Need to verify identities, so that we can ensure that only authorized users can see or modify data.

**ID factors:**  
* What you know:  password, PIN, answer to secret question
* What you have: ATM card, cell phone, smart token
* What you are: biometrics (more on this later)
* What you do: keystroke patterns, voice patterns, signature recognition
* Where you are: at a specific location, using a specific device (trusted path)


## [3. Authorization and Access Control](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 3 - Authorization and Access Control.pptx)
Controlled access: which subjects (human users) have access (read/write/execute) to which objects (files, directories)?

## [4. Auditing Accountability](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 4 - Auditing Accountability.pptx)


## [5. Cryptography](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 5 - Cryptography.pptx)


## [6. Compliance](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 6 - Compliance.pptx)


## [7. Operations Security](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 7 - Operations Security.pptx)
1. Identify critical information. can be internally defined (source code, trade secret, etc.) or external (HIPAA, FERPA, GDPR, etc.)  
2. Threat analysis  
3. Vulnerability analysis  
4. Risk assessment  
5. Apply countermeasures  

**Laws of OpSec**  
1. Know the threats  
2. Know what to protect  
3. Protect the information  

## [8. Human Security](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 8 - Human Security.pptx)
**Password attacks:** brute-force vs. dictionary attacks

**Social engineering**

## [9. Physical Security](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 9 - Physical Security.pptx)
Protect the data by protecting people, equipment, and facilities.

**Major sources of physical threats:**  
* Extreme temperature - extreme heat or cold
* Gases – includes humidity or dry air, gases, suspended particles
* Liquids – includes water, chemicals
* Living organisms – viruses, bacteria, animals, insects
* Projectiles -- powered objects
* Movement – shaking, collapse, slide, vibrating
* Energy anomalies - electrical surge, static electricity, radiation
* People
* Toxins
* Smoke and fire

**Physical security controls:**  
* Deterrent controls - discourage people from violating the security controls.
* Detective controls - sense and report undesirable events.
* Preventive controls - physical means to keep unauthorized entities from breaching your physical security.

## [10. Network Security](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 10 - Network Security.pptx)
**ISO/OSI Reference Model**  
Provides a common basis for coordination of standards.  
Based on a hierarchical model:  
* Application Layer
* Presentation Layer
* Session Layer
* Transport Layer
* Network Layer
* Data Link Layer
* Physical Layer



## [11. Operating System Security](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 11 - Operating System Security.pptx)


## Module 12. Mobile, Embedded, and Internet of Things Security


## Module 13. Application Security


## [14. Security Assessment](../../../papers/CYB110/Module 14 - Security Assessment.pptx)


## [Data Representation](../../../papers/CYB110/DataRepresentation.pptx)

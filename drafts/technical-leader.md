Becoming a Technical Leader  
by Gerald M. Weinberg  


## Definition  
Leadership = "the process of creating an environment in people become empowered"  
I.e. leading the *process*, not the *people*  

The MOI model of leadership:  
Motivation - the trophies or trouble, the push or pull that moves the people involved  
Organization - the existing structure that enables the ideas to be worked through into practice  
Ideas/Innovation - the seeds, the image of what will become  

The process of innovation:  
Understand the problem  
Manage the flow of ideas  
Maintain quality  

Growth/development in the real world always involves: practice, stepwise improvement, and occasional regressions. It's a long, noisy process, but it's the only way any of us ever get better at anything.

'Becoming a Technical Leader'  
by Gerald M. Weinberg  


## Definition  
Leadership is "the process of creating an environment in which people become empowered."  
I.e. leading the *process*, not the *people*  

**The MOI Model of Leadership:**  
Motivation - the trophies or trouble, the push or pull that moves the people involved  
Organization - the existing structure that enables the ideas to be worked through into practice  
Ideas/Innovation - the seeds, the image of what will become  

**The Process of Innovation:**  
Understand the problem  
Manage the flow of ideas  
Maintain quality  

Growth/development in the real world always involves: practice, stepwise improvement, and occasional regressions. It's a long, noisy process, but it's the only way to get better.  


## Innovation  
**The Three Great Obstacles to Innovation:**  
self-blindness, concealing your own behavior, so you have no chance of changing  
No-Problem Syndrome, convincing you that you already know the answer to all problems  
belief in the central dogma of academic phsychology, blinding you to alternative solutions, even ones you could generate without help from anyone else  

Writing in a journal (even just for five minutes a day) can be a great tool for developing self-awareness.  

The problem-solving leader's central dogma: "Any real problem has one *more* solution, which nobody has found-yet."  

Great leaders can recover from failure, because they are driven by an underlying vision. What is important to you? What change would you like to bring about in the world?  


## Motivation  
Communicating with other people is hard, and you will fail unless you try to see things from their point of view. This is the first great obstacle to motivating others.  

**Satir's Interaction Model**  
1. sensory input - What did the other person say?  
2. interpretation - What do I think they meant?  
3. feeling - How do I feel about [interpretation of what interlocutor just said]  
4. feeling about feeling - How do I feel about *that*, based on my existing sense of self-worth?  
5. defense - Does [feeling about feeling] require me to defend myself?  
6. rules for commenting - By now a response is starting to form, which will need to be filtered through the social mores in play. (E.g. I may respond differently to the same comment, based on whether if came from a co-worker, my wife, or a friend.)  
7. outcome - What is the observeable result of the process above?  

This is all fleshed out much more in the book, but the point is that this process a) happens very quickly, b) includes several different steps, c) each of which is error-prone and/or based on asymmetrical information. Any error progegates forward into subsequent steps, and that's before you even hear the result of my internal process, which is then fed back through your model as sensory input, causing you to react in some way which will then...

'Becoming a Technical Leader'  
by Gerald M. Weinberg  


## Definition  
Leadership is "the process of creating an environment in which people become empowered."  
I.e. leading the *process*, not the *people*  

The MOI Model of Leadership:  
Motivation - the trophies or trouble, the push or pull that moves the people involved  
Organization - the existing structure that enables the ideas to be worked through into practice  
Ideas/Innovation - the seeds, the image of what will become  

The Process of Innovation:  
Understand the problem  
Manage the flow of ideas  
Maintain quality  

Growth/development in the real world always involves: practice, stepwise improvement, and occasional regressions. It's a long, noisy process, but it's the only way to get better.  


## Innovation  
The Three Great Obstacles to Innovation:  
self-blindness, concealing your own behavior, so you have no chance of changing  
No-Problem Syndrome, convincing you that you already know the answer to all problems  
belief in the central dogma of academic phsychology, blinding you to alternative solutions, even ones you could generate without help from anyone else  

Writing in a journal (even just for five minutes a day) can be a great tool for developing self-awareness.  

The problem-solving leader's central dogma: "Any real problem has one *more* solution, which nobody has found-yet."  

Great leaders can recover from failure, because they are driven by an underlying vision. What is important to you? What change would you like to bring about in the world?

In Magic, it's really important to always have a plan for how you will win. In particular, one player should be trying to bring the game to a close, while the other should be trying to draw it out. Misassignment of Role = Game Loss, as explained by Michael J Flores in [Who's the Beatdown](../../../_ref/whos the beatdown.html).  

You typically win a game of Magic by accumulating small advantages in terms of cards/resources or time. EDT goes into more detail in [Tempo and Card Advantage](../../../_ref/tempo and card advantage.html).  
  
[Investment](../../../_ref/investment.html) is simply how much work a card/stradegy requires in order to see the payoff. *"In general, I would say that for you to play with cards that require investment, you need to have some way to get long-term card advantage with it. Examples of these cards are Disrupting Scepter and Goblin Bombardment."

The Mythical Man-Month  
by Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.

This book is a classic, and includes a lot of interesting thoughts about software engineering. That said, it really shows its age: it was written in a time when all the devs were men and all the secretaries were women. Also, Brooks writes about god several times in a way that is more... earnest than you'd usually see in a book about writing software.

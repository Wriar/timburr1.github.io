## Cider
**Ingredients**  
* 6 gal. apple juice/cider  
* yeast (I use Fleischman's Active Dry baking yeast, but brewer's yeast might work better)  
* sugar  
* honey, (optional)  
* cloves (optional)  
* carboy or bucket w/ airlock

Sterilizing your equipment is the first, hardest, and most important step. I scrub everything out and rinse it w/ StarSan.  
Once your carboy/bucket is clean, combine sugar, juice, and yeast, as well as honey and cloves to taste.  
*I don't know the details, but yeast don't seem to break down honey in the same way as sugar. Adding more sugar at this point will make the final product dryer and more alcoholic; adding honey will sweeten it, without affecting the alcohol content too much.*
Throw on the airlock, and wait for it to quit bubbling. (This should take a couple 2-3 weeks.)
Optional step: adding juice concentrate during the fermentation process will increase the strength and sweetness of your cider.  

## Kombucha
**Ingredients**  
* water  
* black tea bags  
* sugar  
* starter kombucha or scoby  
* large mason jar
* cheese cloth

Heat the water in a pot on the stovetop.  
When it boils, remove heat and stir in sugar.  
Add tea bags and allow to steep until cool.  
Remove tea bags, combine this mixture and your starter/scoby in the mason jar.  
Cover w/ cheese cloth, and wait a couple of weeks until it starts to smell a little bit.  
Enjoy!

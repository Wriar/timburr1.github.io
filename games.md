You can look at my **Magic: the Gathering** decks [here](https://deckbox.org/users/timburr), if you are into that sort of thing.

I'm also getting into **Warhammer 40k** a little bit. Current army lists:  
[Tyranids, 1251pts](40kArmies/Tyranids_1250.html) (Serve the Hive, feel the groove… I control the way you move…)  

**Kill Team:**  
[Space Marines vs. Melee Horde, 100pts](40kArmies/SpaceMarinesKT_MeleeHorde.html) (Harlequins, Drukhari, Orks, GSC, Tyranids, Gellerpox Infected)  
[Space Marines vs. Power Armor, 100pts](40kArmies/SpaceMarinesKT_PowerArmor.html) (CSM, DG, DW, GK, Necrons, Space Marines)  
[Space Marines vs. Shooty Horde, 100pts](40kArmies/SpaceMarinesKT_ShootyHorde.html) (Tau, IG, AdMech, Asruyani, Starstriders)  
[Tyranids, 100pts](40kArmies/TyranidsKT.html)  

Tyranid Tactics:  
Rapid Regeneration: 2 command points  
Use this tactic when a model from your kill team is taken out of action. Roll a D6. On a 4+ that model is treated as if it had suffered a flesh wound instead.

Adrenaline Surge: 2 command points  
Use this tactic at the end of the fight phase. Pick a model from your kill team. That model can immediately fight an additional time.

Implant Attack: 2 command points  
Use this tactic before an injury roll is made for an enemy model that was reduced to 0 wounds by a model from your kill team in the fight phase. Apply a 2+ modifier to the injury roll.

Predatory Leap: 1 command point  
Use this tactic before making a charge roll for a model from your kill team. Treat this model as if it could FLY when making its charge move.

Single-minded Annihilation: 1-2 command points  
Use this tactic after a model from your kill team shoots in the shooting phase. You can immediately shoot an additional time with that model. This tactic costs 1 command point to use, or 2 command points if used on a Tyranid Warrior.

Legacy of Ymgarl: 1 command point  
Use this tactic when you choose a Genestealer in your kill team to fight in the fight phase. Reroll failed wound rolls for that model until the end of the phase.

You can look at my Magic: the Gathering decks [here](https://deckbox.org/users/timburr), if you are into that sort of thing.

I'm also getting into Warhammer 40k a little bit. I just play Tyranids rn, there is a 1200pt. list [here](40kArmies/tyranids_1200.html), and [this](40kArmies/KillTeam.html) is my first Kill Team list (100pts.) Serve the Hive, feel the groove, I control the way you move...

You can look at my Magic: the Gathering decks [here](https://deckbox.org/users/timburr), if you are into that sort of thing.

I'm also getting into Warhammer 40k a little bit. Current army lists:  
*[Tyranids 40K, 1251pts](40kArmies/Tyranids_1250.html)  
*[Tyranids Kill Team, 102pts](40kArmies/KillTeam.html)  
Serve the Hive, feel the groove... I control the way you move...

You can look at my Magic: the Gathering decks [here](https://deckbox.org/users/timburr), if you are into that sort of thing.

I'm also getting into Warhammer 40k a little bit; my latest tournament list is [here](40kArmies/BattleBros_6-2-18.html), and [this](40kArmies/KillTeam.html) is my first Kill Team list. Serve the Hive, feel the groove, I control the way you move...

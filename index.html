	<p>Hello, my name is Tim! I'm a software developer in the US Pacific Northwest, and this is a test page for my web site. (Actual content to come, I promise.) 
	<br><br>In the meantime, feel free to add me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/timburr1">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://github.com/timburr1">GitHub</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-burr-a39a8866">LinkedIn</a>. You can also email me at the reverse of moc.liamg@rrub.r.mit.
	<br><br>You can look at my Magic: the Gathering decks <a href="https://deckbox.org/users/timburr">here</a>, if you are into that sort of thing...</p>

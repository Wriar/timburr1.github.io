<b>Some thoughts</b>:<br />1. The Egyptian is a pretty cool place to go see a concert. You can stand up front and dance if you want, or just chill in your seat. Either way, probably no one will spill beer on you.<br />2. The opener was a folky kind of act called Vandaveer, from D.C. They are really very good.<br /><br /><b>And a setlist</b>:<br />Icky<br />New York City<br />Call You Mom<br />"Battle for the Planet of the Apes"<br />The Guitar<br />You're on Fire<br />Nanobots <br />(The rest of the show was the entire 'Flood' album, in reverse order:)<br />Road Movie to Berlin<br />They Might Be Giants<br />Sapphire Bullets of Pure Love<br />Women and Men<br />Hot Cha<br />Whistling in the Dark<br />Letterbox<br />Minimum Wage<br />Hearing Aid<br />Someone Keeps Moving My Chair<br />We Want a Rock<br />Twisting<br />Particle Man<br />Your Racist Friend<br />Dead<br />Istanbul (Not Constantinople)<br />Lucky Ball and Chain<br />Birdhouse in Your Soul<br />Intro <br />(encore:)<br />Tesla<br />Dr. Worm
